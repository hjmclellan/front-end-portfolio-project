# The vision:

I intend to use https://deckofcardsapi.com/ to create a card match game.
## It should: 
- Have a home page for players to navigate to the game from
- Ideally, it should handle two players.
- Return a winner/tie popup, then a 'play again?' popup


## Personas:

- Elizabeth Adams:
Student looking for a quick free game to play online. Stumbled upon this, and hopes to try it out.

- Nelson Harris:
A new web-developer looking to see what others have made with js.

- Julie Porter:
A hiring manager at a potential company, looking through my portfolio for an idea of my skills.

- Shawn Gonzalez:
Father of two, looking to play a simple game with his kids without requiring a console
